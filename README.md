# Malware-Analysis-w-REMnux

## Objective

The objective of this lab was to analyze a malicious Microsoft Word document in order to extract relevant information such as the type of exploit it employs, the CVE code associated with the exploit, the name of the malicious software it downloads, the IP address and port it communicates with, and the name of the dropped executable file. 

### Skills Learned

- Malicious document analysis.
- Identifying exploits and associated CVE codes.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Determining communication channels and malware payloads.
- Utilizing various analysis tools such as REMnux, rtfdump.py, rtfobj, shell code analyzer, and Gary Kessler's signatures
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- REMnux (Linux distribution for malware analysis).
- rtfdump.py (RTF file analyzer).
- rtfobj (RTF object extractor).
- scdbg (Shell code analyzer)
- Gary Kessler's signatures (for signature-based analysis)

## Steps
Initial Analysis:
Obtained a suspicious Microsoft Word document.
Fired up REMnux for malware analysis.

RTF Analysis:
Utilized rtfdump.py and rtfobj to extract and analyze RTF objects.
Identified shell code and suspicious patterns using shell code analyzer.

CVE Identification:
Cross-referenced identified exploit patterns with known CVEs.
Found a match with CVE-2017-11882.

Malware Download Analysis:
Tracked network activity to identify the IP address and port the document communicated with.
Determined the downloaded file name as jan2.exe.

Dropped Executable Analysis:
Observed the behavior of the malware and noted the dropped executable as aro.exe.

Validation:
Verified findings using Gary Kessler's signatures for additional confirmation.

## Conclusion:
Through the analysis of the malicious Microsoft Word document, various aspects of the attack were uncovered. The exploit used was identified as CVE-2017-11882, leading to the download of jan2.exe from IP address 185.36.74.48 on port 80. The dropped executable after successful execution was determined to be aro.exe. This exercise enhanced skills in malware analysis, exploit identification, and the utilization of various analysis tools and techniques.
